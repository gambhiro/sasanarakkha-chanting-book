  <p><a href="acknowledgments.xhtml#en1" id="en1appendix"><sup>1</sup></a> Due to the balanced and inspiring selection of chants, as well as for the sake of compatibility, WPN <i>Buddhist Chanting</i> (2014) has served as the basis for this book. Over time, suggestions for the inclusion of additional chants, as well as occasional improvements of existing translations were incorporated. Such changes were meticulously marked down in the endnotes, so that someone familiar with the present book can straight away find the relevant differences, which can be useful when visiting a branch monastery of the Ajahn Chah lineage, in order to know in which places to revert to the original version.</p>

  <p><a href="dedication-of-offerings.xhtml#en2" id="en2appendix"><sup>2</sup></a> WPN: <q>The Lord</q>. The underlying Pāli term is <q><em>Arahant</em></q>. <q>Lord</q>, however, has connotations that do not fit well to the way the Buddha is portrayed in the discourses. In dictionaries <q>lord</q> is commonly defined as: <q>an appellation for a person or deity who has authority, control, or power over others, acting like a master, a chief, or a ruler</q>. The <q>Worthy One</q> seems a better choice of terms, since it is also how <q><em>Arahant</em></q> was used in pre-Buddhist era. PTS explains:<q>[Vedic <em>arhant</em>, ppr. of <em>arhati</em> (see <em>arahati</em>), meaning deserving, worthy]</q>. Throughout this chanting book, all occurrences of <q><em>Arahant</em></q> have therefore been consistently translated as <q>Worthy One</q>, thus replacing previous translations, such as <q>The Lord</q>, <q>Noble One</q> etc.</p>

  <p><a href="homage-buddha.xhtml#en3" id="en3appendix"><sup>3</sup></a> WPN: <q>He trains perfectly those who wish to be trained</q>. The aspect of wishing to be trained is not found in the Pāli.</p>

  <p><a href="homage-buddha.xhtml#en4" id="en4appendix"><sup>4</sup></a> WPN: <q>He has explained the spiritual life of complete purity</q>. While <q>spiritual life</q> is not a bad translation, for the sake of consistency with the rest of the chanting book, this occurrence was changed to <q>holy life</q>.</p>

  <p><a href="homage-sangha.xhtml#en5" id="en5appendix"><sup>5</sup></a> To practice <q>directly</q>(Pāli: <em>uju</em>) means, to practice the most direct way to <em>Nibbāna</em>; the straight way; no detours.</p>

  <p><a href="respect-for-the-dhamma.xhtml#en31" id="en31appendix"><sup>31</sup></a> WPN: <q>lack of Dhamma</q> This translation is problematic, because a mere <q>lack of Dhamma</q> does not lead to rebirth in hell; otherwise all non-Buddhists would be destined to hell. In reality, it is the view and practice of <q>wrong Dhamma</q> that leads to hell, which is also substantiated by the Commentary, which defines <q>adhamma</q> as the opposite (<em>paṭipakkha</em>) of true Dhamma.</p>

It has been shown in Āyasma Aggacitta&#8217;s <q>Do We Go to the Triple Gem for Refuge?</q> that one does not go for refuge in the triple gem (the Buddha, Dhamma, and Ariya-saṅgha), but the discourses repeatedly depict the Buddha, Dhamma, and Bhikkhu-saṅgha as the community to take refuge in (DN 2, MN 91, SN 12.46, AN 2.16 etc.).</p>



  <p><a href="patimokkha-exhortation.xhtml#en36" id="en36appendix"><sup>36</sup></a> There are two variations as to the sequence of these three verses. The sequence used here follows the sequence of Dhp 183 (<em>Sabba pāpassa</em>...), Dhp 184 (<em>Khantī paramaṁ</em>...), Dhp 185 (<em>Anūpavādo</em>...). In contrast, the sequence Dhp 184, 183, 185 is commonly known as the <q><em>Ovādapātimokkha</em></q>, and occurs at DN 14.</p>

  <p><a href="three-characteristics.xhtml#en38" id="en38appendix"><sup>38</sup></a> <q><em>Dukkha</em></q> here refers to the five aggregates themselves, as explained in SN 56.11: <q>The five aggregates of clinging are <em>dukkha</em></q>. Along similar lines, the five aggregates are called <q>burdens</q> in SN 22.22.</p>

  <p><a href="burdens.xhtml#en42" id="en42appendix"><sup>42</sup></a> WPN: <q>The beast of burden though is man</q>. The Pāli word <q><em>puggalo</em></q> is in masculine, which is the expected grammatical form even if a term refers to males and females alike, as is probably the case here. Furthermore, the phrase <q>beast of burden</q> is an English idiomatic expression, signifying <q>an animal used for heavy work such as carrying or pulling things</q> (Oxford Dictionary).</p>

  <p><a href="protection.xhtml#en43" id="en43appendix"><sup>43</sup></a> <q>Unity</q> here refers to unity of mind due to concentration (<em>samādhi</em>, <em>cittass-ekaggatā</em>). <em>Nekatta</em> = <em>na</em> + <em>ekatta</em> [abstr. fr. <em>eka</em>].</p>

  <p><a href="protection.xhtml#en44" id="en44appendix"><sup>44</sup></a> WPN: <q>The dust of passions all the more</q>. The Pāli only speaks of stirring up dust, but the Commentary explains that it refers to the dust of <em>kilesā</em>. As a translation for <em>kilesā</em>, the term <q>defilements</q> has a broader scope than just <q>passions</q>, wherefore the former has been given preference.</p>

  <p><a href="misc-verses.xhtml#en45" id="en45appendix"><sup>45</sup></a> The meaning of this statement is somewhat cryptic. The Commentary explains as follows: <em>pamādo rajo</em> = heedlessness is dust; <em>pamādo pamād&#8217;ānupatito rajo</em> = the dust that follows heedlessness is (also) heedlessness; the Commentary further explains that this is about procrastination, e.g. <q>I am still young, so I can afford to be heedless; maybe later I&#8217;ll be heedful</q>.</p>

  <p><a href="single-excellent-night.xhtml#en46" id="en46appendix"><sup>46</sup></a> WPN: <q><em>viddhā</em></q>. The Siam edition has <em>viddhā</em> (pierced) whereas the Burmese and Sri Lankan edition of the same text have <em>vidvā</em> (the wise), which seems to be the variant that better conveys the intended meaning of the text.</p>

  <p><a href="highest-blessings.xhtml#en50" id="en50appendix"><sup>50</sup></a> The term <q>blessing</q> is used throughout this chanting book to convey the meaning of <q>support</q>, or <q>a beneficial thing</q>, without implying the underlying Christian connotations this term may have in popular use.</p>

  <p><a href="words-on-loving-kindness.xhtml#en57" id="en57appendix"><sup>57</sup></a> What is translated here as <q>cherishing all living beings</q>, could more literally be translated as <q>developing a measureless mind towards all beings</q>.</p>

  <p><a href="words-on-loving-kindness.xhtml#en58" id="en58appendix"><sup>58</sup></a> WPN: <q>to fixed views</q>. This paragraph deals with <em>Anāgāmis</em>, which becomes apparent from the closing statement in which it is said that by this practice one becomes free from sense desires and is not born again into this world (sense sphere). The limitation of loving-kindness practice leading <q>only</q> up to <em>Anāgāmihood</em> also finds confirmation by AN 4.126. Now, since an <em>Anāgāmi</em> has right view, which is the first factor of the noble eightfold path (even <em>Arahants</em> hold right view; AN 10.112), it would therefore not be correct to say that he holds no views at all. Furthermore, even an <em>Anāgāmi</em> may still have some minor grasping to (right) view, as there can still be moments of <em>māna</em> (identification/conceit), which is overcome only by the <em>Arahant</em>. I therefore conclude that this passage here refers specifically to <q>wrong views</q> and does not include <q>right view</q>, since wrong views are the only types of views that an <em>Anāgāmi</em> has entirely left behind.</p>

The reason for this omission is unclear, because even the Thai edition of this discourse contains <q><em>byādhi&#8217;pi dukkho</em></q>. However, the definition of the four noble truths in the context of the <em>Satipaṭṭhānasuttas</em> in DN and MN do not contain <q><em>byādhi&#8217;pi dukkho</em></q>. It may be that the compilers of this chanting book copy/pasted this passage from the wrong discourse, thinking it is the same, whereas in reality there is this small difference.</p>

However, the anoumolous reading <q><em>abhisambuddho</em></q> finds support from <em>Mahāvasutu</em>: <q><em>yāvac cāhaṁ bhikṣavaḥ imāni catvāry āryasatyāni evaṁ triparivartaṁ dvādaśākāraṁ yathā-bhūtaṁ samyakprajñayā nābhyajñāsiṣaṁ na tāvad ahaṁ anuttarāṁ samyaksaṁbodhim abhisaṁbuddho pratijānehaṁ</em></q>, which according to Ven.

  <p><a href="noble-eightfold-path.xhtml#en76" id="en76appendix"><sup>76</sup></a> <q>Quite secluded from sense pleasures</q> means being completely and entirely secluded; not just somewhat/moderately secluded. The Pāli term <q><em>eva</em></q>, which has been translated as <q>quite</q> is an emphatic particle, intensifying the adjective it qualifies. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the English term <q>quite</q> has two connotations: 1. to the utmost – or most – absolute extent or degree; absolutely; completely; 2. To a certain or fairly significant extent or degree; fairly. It is the first connotation in which <q>quite</q> is used in the phrase <q>quite secluded from sense pleasures</q>.</p>

The qualifier <em>ajjhatta</em> as found in the stock formula of the second Jhāna is rendered as <q>inner/self confidence</q>. Alternative translations for <q><em>ajjhattaṁ sampasādanaṁ</em></q> would be <q>inner serenity</q>, <q>inner clarity</q>, <q>inner joy</q>, and it is up to the reader/reciter to reflect on these additional connotations of the term as seen fit.</p>

Therefore, according to SN 48.40 <em>kāya</em> in the context of the third Jhāna stock formula cannot refer to the physical body. The Pāli commentaries agree, and explain that <q><em>kāya</em></q> here refers to the <q>mental body</q>, in particular to mental pleasure (<em>somanassa</em>). However, a comparative study by Prof. Kuan Tse-Fu titled <q><em>Clarification on Feelings in Buddhist Dhyāna/Jhāna Meditation</em></q> brought to light that the Chinese parallel to SN 48.40 has a different sequence of disappearing types of <em>vedanā</em> in the sequence of the four Jhānas. While it would go beyond the scope of this footnote to discuss the matter in detail, it is noteworthy that the parallel to SN 48.40, the <em>Aviparātaka Sūtra</em> of the <em>Āgamas</em>, indeed mentions that bodily pleasant feeling (<em>sukha</em>) disappears only in the fourth Jhāna, whereas mental pleasant feeling (<em>somanassa</em>) has disappeared already in the third Jhāna, alongside with the disappearance of <em>pīti</em>. In the context of this chanting book, we have therefore chosen to stay with the literal translation of the word <q><em>kāya</em></q> as <q>body</q>, and invite the reader to draw his own conclusions.</p>

One such instance can be found in MN 74: <q>Pleasant/unpleasant/neutral feeling, Aggivessana, is impermanent, conditioned, dependently arisen, subject to destruction, vanishing, fading away, and ceasing</q>. Here, <em>virāga</em> obviously does not refer to mental dispassion, but to the nature of fading away of certain phenomena i.e. feeling. Likewise, in the context of mindfulness of breathing, <em>virāga</em> can be seen as part of the natural progression of the lifecycle of any phenomena, including but not limited to the breath itself, which after its arising, goes through a phase of change (<em>aniccā</em>), gradual fading (<em>virāga</em>), and ending in its cessation (<em>nirodha</em>). The meditator observing these stages develops an attitude of letting go (<em>paṭinissagga</em>) towards it, because there is nothing that is worth clinging/adhering to (MN 37).</p>

The first four lines of this chant stem from SN 12.61, which functions as an illustration of the general principle of conditionality.</p>

  <p><a href="dependent-origination.xhtml#en86" id="en86appendix"><sup>86</sup></a> Here and at other places of the English translation, the term <q>a condition</q> is used. The indefinite article <q>a</q> indicates that there could be other conditions as well (e.g. all previous conditions in the sequence are a condition for all subsequent ones), but the directly aforementioned condition is the predominant one (<em>adhipati-paccaya</em>) for the subsequent conditioned thing to arise.</p>

  <p><a href="dependent-origination.xhtml#en87" id="en87appendix"><sup>87</sup></a> Here and at other places of the English translation, the term <q>arises</q> is inserted, because the term <q><em>sambhavati</em></q> from <q><em>Jāti-paccayā jarā-maraṇaṁ; soka-parideva-dukkha-domanass&#8217;upāyāsā sambhavanti</em></q> applies to all 11 links (12 minus ignorance) and not only to ageing-and-death etc.</p>

  <p><a href="dependent-origination.xhtml#en88" id="en88appendix"><sup>88</sup></a> Elsewhere in the chanting book the term <q><em>saṅkhāra</em></q> is translated as <q>volitional formations</q>. Here, however, for the sake of ease of recitability in subsequent passages within this chant, it is translated as <q>formations</q>.</p>

  <p><a href="dependent-origination.xhtml#en89" id="en89appendix"><sup>89</sup></a> In the context of dependent origination, the compound <q><em>nāma-rūpa</em></q> is translated as <q>mind-and-body</q> in order to cover the entirety of what is conventionally called <q>a being, a person</q>. In other contexts, particularly if used separately, these terms may have other connotations.</p>

  <p><a href="dependent-origination.xhtml#en90" id="en90appendix"><sup>90</sup></a> Here and at other places of the English translation, the term <q>arises</q> is inserted, because the term <q><em>sambhavati</em></q> from <q><em>Jāti-paccayā jarā-maraṇaṁ; soka-parideva-dukkha-domanass&#8217;upāyāsā sambhavanti</em></q> applies to all 11 links (12 minus ignorance) and not only to ageing-and-death etc.</p>

  <p><a href="dependent-origination.xhtml#en91" id="en91appendix"><sup>91</sup></a> To render as <q>Therein what is from ignorance as a condition arise formations</q> would be misleading, because it is not the conditioned relationship between A and B (here: ignorance and formations) that gets elaborated upon in the following lines, but it is only the term B (here: formations), that gets defined. Hence the preferable translation: <q>Therein what are &#8216;formations&#8217;, arising from ignorance as a condition?</q></p>

  <p><a href="dependent-origination.xhtml#en92" id="en92appendix"><sup>92</sup></a> SN 12.51 explains: <q><em>Bhikkhus</em>, if a person immersed in ignorance generates a meritorious volitional formation, consciousness fares on to the meritorious; if he generates a demeritorious volitional formation, consciousness fares on to the demeritorious; if he generates an imperturbable volitional formation, consciousness fares on to the imperturbable</q>.</p>

  <p><a href="dependent-origination.xhtml#en93" id="en93appendix"><sup>93</sup></a> While the Pāli term <q><em>mayā</em></q> literally means <q>made of/constructed by</q>, it wouldn&#8217;t be correct to take this passage to mean that giving, virtue, and meditation are the causes for wholesome volition. Rather, the wholeosme volition leads to and expresses itself through giving, virtue, and meditation. Or in the words of Dhp 2: <q>Phenomena are preceded by the mind, surpassed by the mind, created by the mind. If one speaks or acts with a pure mind - happiness follows; just as one&#8217;s shadow that never leaves</q>.</p>

  <p><a href="dependent-origination.xhtml#en94" id="en94appendix"><sup>94</sup></a> Further explained in SN 12.25.</p>

  <p><a href="dependent-origination.xhtml#en95" id="en95appendix"><sup>95</sup></a> <em>Manosañcetanā citta-saṅkhāro</em> is translated here as <q>volition associated with the mind is the mental formation</q>. Despite <em>mano</em> and <em>citta</em> having different shades of meaning in certain contexts, both were translated here as <q>mind</q>. Generally speaking <em>mano</em> refers more to the intellectual, whereas <em>citta</em> covers more the emotional/affective aspects of the mind. A detailed analysis of these terms can be found in Rune E. A. Johansson&#8217;s <q><em>Citta, Mano, Viññāṇa — a Psychosemantic Investigation</em></q>.</p>

  <p><a href="dependent-origination.xhtml#en96" id="en96appendix"><sup>96</sup></a> While Vibh 130 introduces a new definition for <em>nāma</em> as <q><em>vedanā-kkhandho</em>, <em>saññā-kkhandho</em>, <em>saṅkhāra-kkhandho</em>,</q> this definition stands in tension with the discourses, where <em>nāma</em> is consistently defined as <em>vedanā</em>, <em>saññā</em>, <em>cetanā</em>, <em>phassa</em>, <em>manasikāra</em> (e.g. MN 9, SN 12.2). It is for this reason that the passage from Vibh 130 was replaced with the fivefold <em>nāma</em> as found throughout the suttas.</p>

  <p><a href="dependent-origination.xhtml#en97" id="en97appendix"><sup>97</sup></a> The term <em>vāda</em> in <em>attavādupādāna</em> does here not necessarily refer to <q>a doctrine</q> of self, but rather to a person&#8217;s sense of being someone; the sense of being or having a self. This is not exactly the same as personality view, which is destroyed already at the stage of stream-entry. The lingering sense of having a self may continue for a while, despite having already intellectually and/or experientially understood that there is no self to be found in relation to the five aggregates; just as conceit (<em>māna</em>) is overcome only by the path to <em>Arahantship</em>, despite having uprooted personality view already at the stage of stream-entry.</p>

  <p><a href="dependent-origination.xhtml#en98" id="en98appendix"><sup>98</sup></a> Here the Vibh. differs substantially from the analysis found in the suttas. It introduces a distinction between action becoming (<em>kammabhava</em>) and rebirth becoming (<em>upapattibhava</em>). <em>Kammabhava</em> is taken to refer to wholesome, unwholesome and imperturbable actions; <em>upapattibhava</em> is taken to refer to sense/form/formless-sphere becoming, percipient/non-percipient/neither-percipient-nor-non-percipient becoming, one/four/five-component becoming. But since AN 3.76 says that <em>kamma</em> (together with consciousness and craving) is a condition for <em>bhava</em> (if no <em>kamma</em>...then no becoming in the sense-sphere etc. would be discerned), it is not fit to say that <em>kamma</em> itself is a form of <em>bhava</em> (<em>kammabhava</em>). However, it would go too far for the purpose of this chanting book, to discuss further implications of the analysis found in Vibh. For the sake of simplicity and emphasis on the earliest strata of the Buddha&#8217;s teachings, we substituted the passage from Vibh. with the passage from SN 12.2, which defines becoming (<em>bhava</em>) simply as sense/form/formless-sphere becoming. Understood in this way, becoming (<em>bhava</em>) functions as an intermediary between clinging and birth, highlighting the gradual process of how rebirth in one of the three planes of existence takes place. This can even include an interim period between death and birth; thus it is called <q>becoming</q>, rather than instant birth straight after death.</p>

  <p><a href="dependent-origination.xhtml#en99" id="en99appendix"><sup>99</sup></a> While SN 12.2 does not contain a full elaboration on all types of <em>dukkha</em>, a similar analysis is found in DN 22.</p>

  <p><a href="dependent-origination.xhtml#en100" id="en100appendix"><sup>100</sup></a> While SN 12.2 does not contain an elaboration on the different types of misfortune (<em>vyasana</em>), it is found in DN 33, AN 4.192, and AN 5.130. <em>Diṭṭhi</em> here does not mean just any view, but <q>right view</q>. The loss of other views would not be particularly unfortunate from a Buddhist perspective, especially the loss of wrong view could be regarded as a great blessing. The right view that is lost in this example is not the right view of a noble disciple, but the right view of a worldling (<em>puthujjana</em>), whose right view is not unshakeable and who may or may not change his view later on throughout the course of the present life or subsequent births.</p>

  <p><a href="dhamma-in-brief.xhtml#en101" id="en101appendix"><sup>101</sup></a> Anglicising of Pāli words is quite arbitrary. For masc. and neuter we use the stem, but for fem. we use the nominative, wherefore <em>Gotami</em> (voc.) becomes <em>Gotamī</em>.</p>

  <p><a href="principles-of-non-decline.xhtml#en102" id="en102appendix"><sup>102</sup></a> In <em>Girimānandasutta</em> (AN 10.60) the Buddha instruced Ven. Ānanda: <q>If, Ānanda, you visit the (severely sick) bhikkhu Girimānanda and speak to him about ten perceptions, it is possible that on hearing about them his affliction will immediately subside</q>. Then the same seven perceptions as above are mentioned, with the addition of the following three: 8. the perception of non-delight in the entire world; 9. the perception of impermanence in all conditioned phenomena, and 10. mindfulness of breathing. <em>Girimānandasutta</em> concludes: <q>Then, when the Venerable Ānanda had learned these ten perceptions from the Blessed One, he went to the Venerable Girimānanda and spoke to him about them. When the Venerable Girimānanda heard about these ten perceptions, his affliction immediately subsided</q>.</p>
