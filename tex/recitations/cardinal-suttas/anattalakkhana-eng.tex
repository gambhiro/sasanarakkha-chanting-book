I have opted for the first option here because the discourse addresses the group of five monks who all were \textit{Ariyas} already at that time, but it needs to be kept in mind that the term \textit{ariyasāvaka} does not always refer to individuals who have already attained one of the four paths or fruits. This can be seen from MN 27, where a person is referred to as \textit{ariyasāvaka} without reference to any form of awakening-attainment. It is only at the end of the discourse that this \textit{ariyasāvaka} attains awakening.}}}}}\makeatother \thinspace\hspace{-0.5mm}\anglebracketright\
