Step 1: Calculate the Scale Factor
Calculate the ratio of the A6 paper width to the A5 paper width (or height, as they are proportional):

Given:

A5 paper width = 148mm
A6 paper width = 105mm
Scale Factor = A6 Width / A5 Width = 105mm / 148mm ≈ 0.709

Step 2: Adjust Font Size
Assuming the font size in the A5 project is 12pt:

Adjusted Font Size = Font Size in A5 × Scale Factor
Adjusted Font Size = 12pt × 0.709 ≈ 8.508pt

So, for the A6 project, you would use a font size of around 8.5pt to maintain comparable proportions with the A5 project.

Step 3: Test and Adjust
Compile the A6 project with the adjusted font size and visually compare the layout with the A5 project. Fine-tune the font size further if necessary to achieve the desired consistency.

Here's a summary of the example:

A5 Paper Size: 148mm × 210mm
A6 Paper Size: 105mm × 148mm
Scale Factor: ≈ 0.709
Font Size in A5 Project: 12pt
Adjusted Font Size for A6 Project: ≈ 8.5pt
