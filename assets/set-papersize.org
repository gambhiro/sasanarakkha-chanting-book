#+title: Set Papersize

In LaTeX, you can set the paper size of your document using various methods depending on the document class you are using. Here are some common ways to set the paper size:

1. **Using the `geometry` package**: This package allows you to customize the page layout, including paper size. You can specify the paper size using the `\usepackage` command in the preamble:

```latex
\usepackage[paperwidth=<width>, paperheight=<height>]{geometry}
```

Replace `<width>` and `<height>` with the desired dimensions, such as `a4paper`, `letterpaper`, or specific dimensions like `width=8.5in, height=11in`.

2. **Using the `article` class**: If you're using the `article` class, you can specify the paper size as an option:

```latex
\documentclass[a4paper]{article}
```

Other supported options are `letterpaper`, `legalpaper`, and `executivepaper`.

3. **Using the `report` or `book` class**: Similar to the `article` class, you can specify the paper size as an option when using the `report` or `book` class:

```latex
\documentclass[a4paper]{report}
```

4. **Using the `memoir` class**: The `memoir` class provides extensive customization options for document layout. To set the paper size, you can use the `\setstocksize` command in the preamble:

```latex
\documentclass{memoir}
\setstocksize{<width>}{<height>}
```

Replace `<width>` and `<height>` with the desired dimensions.

5. **Using the `geometry` command directly**: If you prefer to set the paper size directly without using packages or document class options, you can use the `\geometry` command in the preamble:

```latex
\geometry{paperwidth=<width>,paperheight=<height>}
```

Again, replace `<width>` and `<height>` with the desired dimensions.

Choose the method that best suits your needs and document structure.
