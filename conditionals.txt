Yes, it's clear! You can achieve this in LaTeX by using conditionals provided by LaTeX itself or through packages like etoolbox. Here's a basic example of how you could implement such conditionals:

latex
Copy code
\documentclass{anecdote} % Default format

% Define a conditional for A4 format
\newif\ifAfour
\Afourfalse % Default is false

% Define a conditional for A6 format
\newif\ifAsix
\Asixfalse % Default is false

% Uncomment one of the following lines depending on your export format
%\Afourtrue % If you're exporting to A4 format
%\Asixtrue % If you're exporting to A6 format

\usepackage{etoolbox}

\begin{document}

% Example of conditional content
\ifAfour
    % Content specific to A4 format
    This content is specific to A4 format.
\else
    % Content for other formats
    This content is for other formats.
\fi

% Example of another conditional content
\ifAsix
    % Content specific to A6 format
    This content is specific to A6 format.
\else
    % Content for other formats
    This content is for other formats.
\fi

% Root text goes here, with conditionals scattered as needed

\end{document}
In this example:

\newif\ifAfour and \newif\ifAsix define two conditionals named \ifAfour and \ifAsix.
\Afourfalse and \Asixfalse set the default values of the conditionals to false.
Depending on the export format, you can set the appropriate conditional to true using \Afourtrue or \Asixtrue.
\ifAfour and \ifAsix are used to conditionally include or exclude specific content in your document based on the chosen format.
You can place these conditionals throughout your document wherever you need to adjust content based on the export format.
